    <p>Hey there,</p>

    <p>My name is Dino, and I'm the Co-Founder of BloodNation.</p>

    <p>I couldn't be happier to welcome you to the BloodNation community and to help you start donating blood across the nation.</p>

    <p>No matter the distance or state you reside, you can be sure that you'll find the bloodbank or hospital that you need... and maybe a few that you didn't even know you needed yet!</p>

    <p>Click this link to complete your registration <a href="${link}">Confirm Registration</a></p>

    <p>Regards<br/>Dino Rhythms</p>
